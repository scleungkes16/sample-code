<p style="text-align: center;"><span>(Last Updated August 1, 2017)</span></p>

These Terms govern your access and use of the Coinetion &ldquo;Service&rdquo;, which refers individually and collectively to all written or electronic materials, data, text, audio video, images or other content ("Content") and software made available through the www.coinetion.com website ("Site"). These Terms refer to the individual or entity using the Service (including any component of the Service) as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>By using the Service, visiting the Site, or registering for an account with us, you are accepting and agreeing to these Terms, and the policies and guidelines referenced in these Terms. These Terms require the use of arbitration to resolve disputes on an individual basis, rather than jury trials or on resolution a collective basis.</span></p>

If you have a Coinetion account, Coinetion will send you a message notifying you of the amended Terms when you use the Service, or by email sent to the address in your Coinetion account.

<h4>1 About Bitcoin And The Coinetion Service</h4>
<p><span>1.1 Bitcoin Network Information.</span></p>
<p><span>The Service does not send or receive money. As a bitcoin wallet, the Service enables you to interface with the bitcoin network to view and transmit information about a public cryptographic key commonly referred to as a bitcoin address &ndash; sometimes referred to herein as a &ldquo;</span><span>Coinetion Channel Address</span><span>bitcoin account&rdquo;. In order to effectively transmit information about a Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account to the bitcoin network, the private key(s) corresponding with the Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account is required. The Service requires three private cryptographic keys to be associated with each Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account and Coinetion controls only one of these private keys. Two of the three private keys associated with a Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account are required in order to effect a &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; of bitcoin from a Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account (i.e., disassociate bitcoin from a Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account and re-associate bitcoin with another bitcoin account). Once the bitcoin network recognizes the information you send from the Service and validates it, the information is broadcasted to other individuals and companies in the bitcoin network and the Service cannot be used by you to cancel or reverse bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>1.2 Key Management.</span></p>
<p><span>Coinetion controls only one of the three private keys for a Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin account on the Service &nbsp;and you aresolely responsible for maintaining the security of the other two private keys. In the event you appoint a third party to control one or more of your private key(s), whether or not such appointment is made through the Service (e.g, through a key recovery service), Coinetion is not responsible for the action or inaction of such third party.</span></p>
<p><span>1.3 Your Coinetion Channel AddressBitcoin Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>Your individual Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin accounts are your property and your responsibility. The Service utilizes these Coinetion Channel Addressbitcoin accounts only to provide the functionality of a bitcoin wallet. Coinetion cannot make transactions using your bitcoin accounts except in conjunction with a request or command through the Service. You may need both of the private keys not controlled by Coinetion to initiate a &ldquo;bitcoin&rdquo; transferCoinetion Channel Address.</span></p>
<p><span>1.4 Passwords and Security.</span></p>
<p><span>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all login IDs, passwords, private bitcoin keys, personal identification numbers (PINs), and any other codes that you use to access the Service. You are solely responsible for properly backing up and storing all of your private keys and PINs. You must keep your account ID, passwords any other account credentials confidential and not authorize any third party to access or use the Service on your behalf, unless we provide an approved mechanism for such use. You must contact customer support immediately by email at support@Coinetion.com if you suspect misuse of your account or any security breach. You will be responsible, and Coinetion will have no liability, for all activity that takes place with your Coinetion Service account accessed using your account credentials whether or not authorized by you. In the event of any such unauthorized use, you will take all steps necessary to terminate such unauthorized use, and cooperate with Coinetion as Coinetion may reasonably request.</span></p>
<p><span>1.5 Identity Authentication.</span></p>
<p><span>You must be at least 18 years old, or such higher age required by applicable law, to register for a Coinetion Service account. You will provide Coinetion and its affiliates with accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration process or as Coinetion may, from time to time request, and keep such information updated. You authorize Coinetion to make such inquiries that it considers necessary to validate your identity and you agree that Coinetion may do so using third party service providers.</span></p>
<p><span>1.6 Third Party Applications.</span></p>
<p><span>If you grant express permission for a third party to connect to your Coinetion Service account, either through the third party's product or through the Service, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold Coinetion responsible for, and will indemnify Coinetion from, any liability arising from the actions or omissions of this third party in connection with the permissions you grant. You may change or remove these permissions from the account settings page.</span></p>
<p><span>1.7 Taxes.</span></p>
<p><span>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to any transactions you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Coinetion is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>1.8 Bitcoin Risks.</span></p>
<p><span>Coinetion has no control over, and makes no representations regarding the value of bitcoins, or the security of the bitcoin network. The value of bitcoin can change rapidly, increase or decrease unexpectedly, and potentially even fall to zero. You acknowledge that participation in the bitcoin network involves risk. A bitcoin transaction may be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or longer) and may be never complete if it remains in a pending state.</span></p>
<p><span>1.9 Coinetion Instant Transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>Coinetion may, in its sole discretion, enable you to use the Service to send or receive a &ldquo;Coinetion Instant&rdquo; transfer (a &ldquo;Coinetion Instant Transaction&rdquo;). A Coinetion Instant Transaction allows certain eligible parties who enter into a separate relying party agreement with Coinetion to receive the benefit of a limited warranty from Coinetion regarding the confirmation of such transaction on the bitcoin block chain, subject to certain exceptions. Although third parties may make certain offers or representations to senders who initiate Coinetion Instant Transactions (e.g., an exchange may offer instant credit to users who make &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; via Coinetion Instant Transactions), Coinetion does not endorse, is not a party to, nor shall it be held liable for, any such representations, offers, or inducements. THE LIMITED WARRANTY MADE IN CONNECTION WITH Coinetion INSTANT TRANSACTIONS, IF ANY, IS NOT MADE TO THE SENDER OR ANY PARTY OTHER THAN ELIGIBLE INTENDED RECIPIENTS OF Coinetion INSTANT TRANSACTIONS WHO HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE, RELYING PARTY AGREEMENT IN A FORM PROVIDED BY Coinetion.</span></p>
<p><span>If you send a Coinetion Instant Transaction, you warrant to Coinetion that the consideration transferred is valid and will be confirmed on the Bitcoin block chain. Coinetion makes no warranty to you regarding the confirmation of such transaction on the Bitcoin block chain, and does not warrant to you that the consideration will be immediately available to the recipient.</span></p>
<p><span>If you receive a Coinetion Instant Transaction, you are not eligible to receive a limited warranty from Coinetion and may no rely upon the status of a transaction as a Coinetion Instant Transaction unless you have executed a separate relying party agreement, in the form provided by Coinetion.</span></p>

<p><span>5.4 Choice of Law.</span></p>
<p><span>These Terms and the relationship between you and Coinetion shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of California without regard to their conflicts of laws provisions. The parties specifically exclude from application to these Terms the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.</span></p>
<p><span>5.5. Arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span>YOU AND Coinetion AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE WALLET OR THESE TERMS SHALL BE DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. You agree that you and Coinetion are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of other terms or the termination of your Coinetion Service account. 5.5.1. Notice. The party seeking arbitration must notify the other as follows. If you seek arbitration, you must send to Coinetion, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice") to the address at the end of these terms ("Notice Address"). If Coinetion seeks arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the address in your registration information, or if you have not provided your address, then to the email address we have for your account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Coinetion, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages that are limited or waived by these Terms (such as punitive damages, treble damages, or any other damages which are not compensatory), to the extent such limitation or waiver is permitted under applicable law. The arbitration proceedings and decision of the arbitrator shall be kept confidential (and may not be disclosed) by the parties or the arbitrator, except to the extent necessary to compel any award made by the arbitrator. 5.5.2. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The arbitrator shall be bound by these Terms. The arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco, California. However, if you reside outside of the United States of America, you will afford Coinetion the opportunity to elect to make the arbitration convenient by either: (a) being conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, with the parties participating through a telephonic hearing; or (b) arbitrating in your country of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you and Coinetion. 5.5.3. YOU AND Coinetion AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Coinetion agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. 5.5.4. CHOICE OF FORUM IN LIEU OF ARBITRATION. IF THE PROVISIONS IN SECTION 5.5.3 ARE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN SECTION 5.5 WILL BE DEEMED VOID AND WITHOUT AFFECT. FURTHER, IF ARBITRATION CANNOT BE COMPELLED UNDER THE TERMS SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.5, OR IF SECTION 5.5.3 IS NOT ENFORCEABLE, THEN YOU AND Coinetion AGREE AND IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A. FOR ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS.</span></p>
<p><span>5.6 Notices.</span></p>
<p><span>Except for notices of a party seeking arbitration that are governed by Section 5.5.1, all notices or communications to be given under these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered upon delivery in person, by facsimile communication with written confirmation, by courier service with its confirmation of delivery to the proper address, or by United States certified, registered, first class or equivalent mail with written confirmation of receipt; each as addressed to the parties at their addresses as set forth in Section 5.5.1, as each party may update from time to time.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5 Savings Clause.</span></p>
<p><span>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. If the court or arbitrator cannot do so, then the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should strike the invalid or unenforceable provisions, and that the remaining provisions be given their full force and effect.</span></p>
<p><span>6.6 Company Use.</span></p>

<p><span>6.7 Interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>The section titles in these Terms and summary descriptions (labeled "English") are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms will not be construed in favor of or against any party by reason of the extent to which any party participated in the drafting of these Terms. The failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; as used in these Terms has the same meaning as &ldquo;and/or&rdquo;. The terms &lsquo;include&rsquo; and &lsquo;including&rsquo; will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase &ldquo;without limitation.&rdquo;</span></p>
